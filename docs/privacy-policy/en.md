_Last Updated: October 7, 2024_

At **Listize**, we are committed to safeguarding your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our grocery shopping list application ("the App"). By using **Listize**, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the App.

## 1. Information We Collect

### a. **Device Information (When Providing Feedback)**
We collect device information such as:
- Device type (e.g., smartphone, tablet)
- Operating system version
- App version


This information is collected **only** when you submit feedback to help us troubleshoot and improve the App.

### b. **Account Information (Social Login)**
If you create an account using social login (e.g., Google, Apple, Facebook), we may collect the following information from the third-party provider:

- **Name**
- **Email Address**
- **Profile Picture** (if available)

We only collect the information necessary for account creation and authentication. Your social login credentials (e.g., password) are not shared with us. Instead, the third-party provider manages your login process securely.

### c. **Shopping List Data (AI Services)**
When you use **Listize**'s AI-powered features (such as generating grocery lists or receiving recommendations), your shopping list data may be shared with third-party AI service providers for processing. This data is used solely to deliver AI-related functionalities within the App.

The information shared with AI services may include:

- **Grocery list contents** (e.g., items you add, categories)
- **Related metadata** (e.g., quantities, preferences, dietary restrictions, or shopping habits)

We ensure that third-party AI providers adhere to data protection standards, but once your data is shared with these providers, it is processed in accordance with their privacy policies.

### d. **User Feedback**
When you provide feedback, you may include additional details, such as descriptions of issues, screenshots, or suggestions. This information is voluntary and helps us address your feedback effectively.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information collected to:

- **Provide and Improve the App**: Including troubleshooting, enhancing features, and ensuring functionality across different devices.
- **AI-Powered Services**: Process shopping list data with third-party AI services to generate recommendations, improve list suggestions, and enhance your grocery shopping experience.
- **Account Management**: Allow you to log in and manage your account using social login and access certain features of the App.
- **Customer Support**: Address any issues or concerns you raise through feedback or other communication.

We do not collect or use personal information for any other purposes without your consent.

## 3. Sharing Your Information

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties, except in the following situations:

### a. **Third-Party AI Providers**
When you use AI-powered features in **Listize**, we share your grocery list data with trusted third-party AI providers to generate recommendations or enhance your shopping experience. These providers process your data to deliver the requested AI functionality and are bound by strict confidentiality and data protection agreements.

However, please note that while we take steps to protect your data, the third-party providers handle the actual processing, and their privacy practices govern how they use your information.

### b. **Other Third-Party Service Providers**
We may use third-party providers to help us process feedback, manage social login authentication, and store data. These providers are bound by confidentiality agreements and cannot use your data for any purpose other than what we authorize.

### c. **Legal Requirements**
If required by law, we may disclose your information to comply with legal obligations or respond to lawful requests (e.g., court orders or government investigations).

## 4. Data Security

We take data security seriously and implement industry-standard measures to protect your account details, shopping list data, and device information. When you log in via social media or share grocery lists for AI processing, we use secure protocols to ensure the protection of your data. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.

## 5. Account Management and Data Retention

### a. **Access and Update Your Account**
You can access and update your account information through the App or the social login provider’s platform.

If you need assistance, please contact us at support@listize.com.

### c. **Data Retention**
We retain your information as long as your account is active or as needed to provide services. If you delete your account, we will delete or anonymize your data, except where retention is required by law.
